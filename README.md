# hello-world
A place to store ideas and resources.
Hello, everyone. My name is Tong, it's my 1st year of college. I love playing sports, reading books, and playing the piano. 
Before I started doing a new thing, I was always nervous about how hard it might be and I did not acquire much confidence. However, after I tried and finished the new thing, I changed to become more assertive and obtain more interest on doing other fresh things.
